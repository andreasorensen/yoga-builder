## Learning goals

The objective of this project was to showcase my understanding of React.js, React Router, E2E Cypress Testing & async JavaScript by developing an app meeting a small MVP, all in in a six day sprint. This app accomplishes these goals, complete with user profiles, user stories, accessibility & responsive design.

You can find the details outlined [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/showcase.html).

## Tech/Frameworks

- React.js
- React Router
- Cypress E2E
- CSS
- Rest API
- GitHub Projects
- GitHub
- Git
- Canva (wireframe)

## Testing

Testing was done using Cypress E2E, in the Electron browser. 
To run: `cd` into project and `npm run cypress` after following the installation instructions outlined above.

## Wins & Challenges

All the wins were once challenges. Pushing through the bugs & find workable solutions were a challenge and a win, all the same. Some specific examples are: 

- Trouble-shooting Cypress tests & refactoring my code to prevent unnecessary fetch calls on load of the app (& unexpected unstubbed requests)

- Finding a workaround to my CSS behaving differently on Safari browser.

- Finding an open-source API that allows me to have fun developing an app from the (front-end) ground up was challenging at first, but once I did, it became a big win!

## Extensions

- User authentication 
- Allow users to create their own sequences
- Allow users to write comments about the sequences/asanas
